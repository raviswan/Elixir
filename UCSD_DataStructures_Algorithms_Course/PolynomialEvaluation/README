A 'TestPoly' class is used to create, evaluate and print the polynomial. This 
code is in "testPoly.cpp". This source file in turn invokes "list.cpp" to create
singly linked list. "main.cpp" is used to instantiate and test TestPoly object.

Please run the program from the command line as follows:
>g++ -o poly list.cpp testPoly.cpp main.cpp
>./poly
